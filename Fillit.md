# Fillit

Fillit is a project objective is the search for an optimal solution among a very large number of possibilities, within a reasonable time. In the case of this project, it will be a question of arranging Tetrominos between them and to determine the smallest possible square that can accommodate them using backtracking algorithm.

The goal of this project is to introduce you to basic algorithm and to have you manipulate inputs.

- Analyse the map
- Identify the best arrangement for Tetrominos
- Write the solution on the standard output

```
./fillit ./test_files/test1
```
